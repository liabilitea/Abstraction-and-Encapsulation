# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation
***
## Description

Abstraction and Encapsulation are both pillar concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. Abstraction in OOP simplifies code by focusing on necessary details, while encapsulation organizes and protects related data through controlled accessibility. This repository comprises three Python projects that showcase the use of Abstraction and Encapsulation. 

The Test Drive for each class (fan, car, and pet) has a separate main class where the methods are defined. Furthermore, the outputs were designed using pyfiglet and termcolor. 

## How To Use / Run 

1. Install Python on your computer to run the code. You can download its latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open an IDE and paste the code.
3. Save the file with a .py extension.
4. Run the code.
5. Follow the instructions (for Test_pet) and input the necessary information to see the final output.
